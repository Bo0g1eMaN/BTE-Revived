# BTE-Resurfaced
Barotrauma Extended modified to not be a core package and thus highly resistant to future updates.

This is a repository of the one widely-available functional version of BTE. It is missing a lot of vital content from Legacy Barotrauma Extended, so expect a lot of missing, broken, glitchy, and straight-up buggy content.
This fork alters filepaths and reimplements missing images from Bo0g1eMaN's fork of BTE to make it work without being a core package.
It also fixes general bugs that were unaddressed in the aforementioned fork.
In addition, this is also a repo for which the people who are directly involved in the development for Barotrauma Extended - Revived's Steam Workshop page.
